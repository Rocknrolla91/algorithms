/*
 DFS has many application in Graph Theory. With DFS we can solve tasks like:
 	* detecting a cycle in a graph
 	* topological sort
 	* edge classification

 	and many more (some are represented in this project).

 DFS search idea is to visit all vertices of the graph in depth approach.

 Recursion is very great to use here: in current adjacency list (of a 'root_vertex') explore recursively each vertex

 DFS_visit() is a recusion part of the search

 DFS itself helps to visit all vertices of the graph that might unreachable from the first given vertex (ex.: Directed graph or Disconnected graph)
