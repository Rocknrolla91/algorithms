/*
 Edge Classification task is a classical appication of DFS in graphs.

 4 types of Edges:
 	1. Tree edges: Parent structure represent all tree edges (edges that lead to unvisited node)
 	2. Forward edges: Edges go from a vertex to descended (in tree/forest)
 	3. Backward edges: Edges go from a vertex to ancestor (in tree/forest)
 	4. Cros edges: All other edges (non-ancestor related subtrees or nodes)
