# algorithms
This repo contains most common algorithms and DS implementations
Current list:
  1. **Stack implemented with Linked List**
  2. **Queue implemented with Linked List**
  3. **Stack implemented from a Queue**
  4. **Queue implemented from a Stack**
  5. **Binary Search Tree**:
    1. Depth traversal (with and InOrder without recursion)
      * Pre-, In-, Post-order traversals using recursion
      * In-order traversal using Stack
      * In-order traversal without recursion or Stack - Morris traversal
    2. Breadth traversal (using queue)
    3. Breadth traversal (using height of the tree)
    3. Search and findMin (for tree nad a subtree)
    4. Insertion and Deletion
  6. AVL tree balancing *TBD*
  7. Red-Black tree *TBD*
  8. **Dynamic Programming**
    1. Factorial and Fibonacci
    2. Binomial Coefficients
    3. Jump Stairs task:
  
       >*A child is running up a staircase with n steps, and can hop either 1 step, 2 steps or 3 steps at a time.*
       >*Implement a method to count how many possible ways the child can run up the stairs.*
    4. Amount from given denominations:
       
       > *Write a function that, given:*
          >  * *an amount of money*
          >  * *a list of coin denominations*

       > *computes the number of ways to make amount of money with coins of the available denominations.*
    4. Knapsack problem
  9. **Interesting tasks**
    * Reverse a sentance
