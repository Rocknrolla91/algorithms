# Algorithms Study Cases

This repo contains most common algorithms and DS implementations. Solution are implemented in [```c++```](c++) or [```python```](python).

To execute implemented tasks please follow the instructions in **wiki** of this repo.
##### ```Makefiles``` are provided: [wiki](https://github.com/UseTheApi/algorithms/wiki/Setting-up-a-local-project)
The list of implemented tasks is represented in ```Readme.md```.

Descriptions for each task and solution are in folders (click on links in task lists).
