# Stack from Linked List

#### Task
Implement a Stack linear Data Structure using Linked List.

#### Notes

Each node of a ```stack``` has a data and pointer to a next node. Then methods of the stack:

  * Push - add to stack - is adding a node to a head of List
  * Pop - remove from stack - is removing a node from the head of List

This implementation represents a ```class template``` that allows to create a queue of nodes of any type.

```make``` helps generate main and test binaries to run tests or interactive main program.

#### Targets:
  * ```make build```
  * ```make run```
  * ```make test```
  * ```make clean```
