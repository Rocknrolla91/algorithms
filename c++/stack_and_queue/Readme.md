# Stack And Queue

Stack and Queue are fundamental DSs that represent data storage as a linear array with special methods.

### Stack
Stack is an Abstract Linear Data Structure that supports a LIFO (last-in-first-out) accounting method.
Stack supports 3 methods:
  * Top - get the top of the stack
  * Push - add a node to stack
  * Pop - remove node from stack

### Queue
Queue is an Abstract Linear Data Structure that support a FIFO (first-in-first-out) accounting method.
Queue supports 3 methods:
  * Front - get the top of the queue
  * Enqueue - add a node to queue
  * Dequeue - remove a node from queue

### implementations

There are different implementations for ```stack``` and ```queue```, but in most common implementations ```array``` or ```linked list``` are used. Check sources to get more information.
