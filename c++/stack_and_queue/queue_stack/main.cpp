/*
 Implementing Queue from a Stack can be done using two ways: by making Dequeue() costly or Enqueue() costly
 in the case of making Dequeue() costly there is a complication of a need to perform same actions for Top(),
 so it is preferred in this implementation to use approach of an expensive Enqueue()

 Costly Dequeue() method is implemented in a private section of class QueueFromStack
