# Set Up cmake project.

For each folder there is a CMakeLists.txt file. To run each project follow these simple instructions:
  1. Create a build/ folder inside the local project (near CMakeLists.txt).
  2. Execute command: ```cmake ".."```
  3. Execute command: ```make```
  4. Previous step will create a binary file. Then just execute the binary file with ```./name_of_file``` command
