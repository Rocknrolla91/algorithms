# Algorithms Study Cases

This repo contains most common algorithms and DS implementations. Solution are implemented in ```c++``` or [```python```](python).

To execute implemented tasks please follow the instructions in **wiki** of this repo. 
The list of implemented tasks is represented in ```Readme.md```

Description for each task and solution is in folders (click on links in task lists)

## Current List:

### Stack & Queue: [stack_and_queue/](c++/stack_and_queue)
    
   1. Stack implemented with Linked List: [**stack_linked_list/**](c++/stack_and_queue/stack_linked_list)
   2. Queue implemented with Linked List: [**queue_linked_list/**](c++/stack_and_queue/queue_linked_list)
   3. Special Stack with getMin() method : [**special_stack/**](c++/stack_and_queue/special_stack)
   4. Stack implemented from a Queue: [**stack_queue/**](c++/stack_and_queue/stack_queue)
   5. Queue implemented from a Stack: [**queue_stack/**](c++/stack_and_queue/queue_stack)
